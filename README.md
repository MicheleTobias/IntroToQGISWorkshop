# Intro To QGIS Workshop
Instructions &amp; data for an introductory QGIS workshop

## When & Where: 
3:00-4:00 | Tuesday, June 13th
DSI Classroom | room 360 Shields Library

## Prepare:
Bring your laptop with QGIS (2.18) installed - visit QGIS.org for free download

## Description:
This workshop will introduce participants to QGIS, a powerful open source GIS software.  The workshop will cover typical basic GIS software workflow needs such as loading data, changing the way data is displayed, and where to find analysis tools.  In addition, participants will learn strategies for finding help with QGIS and tutorials for home learning. This workshop is not intended to teach all the concepts of GIS from the beginning (it's only an hour!), but rather to introduce those already familiar with the concepts of GIS to a new software option for applying those concepts.
